# The Final Reel – v0.1 (2025-06-28)

_First public preview – the reels start spinning!_

---

## 🚀 Highlights

• **Core browsing experience** – home page with trending & popular carousels and search page with live results.  
• **Movie Detail 2.0** – cinematic hero, trailer modal, UK age-rating badge, _brand-new_ Cast & Crew spotlight and Similar Movies recommendations.  
• **Watchlist** – authenticated users can save movies to a private list.  
• **Playlists MVP** – create shareable sets of movies.  
• **Reviews** – write, edit, and delete your own reviews (with profanity filtering) while everyone can read approved entries thanks to Supabase RLS.  
• **Dark Neon UI** – Tailwind + Framer-motion for buttery-smooth interactions.

## 🛠  Tech Notes

* **Supabase Postgres** with migrations in `supabase/migrations/`  
  – Added `reviews` table & RLS policies.  
* **TMDB** integration via bearer token, with helper methods in `src/lib/tmdb.ts`.  
* **React Query** for caching & optimistic updates, **Framer-motion** for animation.  
* **ESLint + Prettier** enforced project-wide.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes / Migration Guide

1. Run SQL migration `create_reviews_table.sql` **or** execute the policies manually:
   ```sql
   -- see README for full commands
   ```
2. Update `.env` with `VITE_TMDB_*` and Supabase credentials.

## 🐞 Known Issues

* Streaming-availability cards are stubbed – pending external API key.
* No pagination for user playlists (coming v0.2).
